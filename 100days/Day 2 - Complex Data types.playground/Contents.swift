 Sets are collections of values just like arrays, except they have two differences:

 Items arenâ€™t stored in any order; they are stored in what is effectively a random order.
 No item can appear twice in a set; all items must be unique.

name.1

/*
 Remember, you can change the values inside a tuple after you create it, but not the types of values. So, if you tried to change name to be (first: "Justin", age: 25) you would get an error.
